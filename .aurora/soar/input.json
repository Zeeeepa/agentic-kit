  "prompt": "Original Query: how does LLM know when to invoke CoT or ToT? what is the most commonly usef fromulas?\n\nSynthesized Answer:\nBased on the research conducted, I need to clarify that the agent outputs did not successfully retrieve the requested information about Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) reasoning techniques. The business-analyst agents assigned to research CoT prompting (Agent: business-analyst, Subgoal 0), ToT prompting (Agent: business-analyst, Subgoal 1), and the invocation mechanisms (Agent: business-analyst, Subgoal 2) all returned empty summaries with 0.00 confidence, indicating they were unable to complete their research tasks. The master agent (Agent: master, Subgoal 3) misinterpreted the request and asked for clarification about which domain of formulas was needed (Excel, testing, project management, etc.), rather than understanding the query was specifically about LLM reasoning techniques. **What I can clarify about your question:** Your query asks about two advanced prompting/reasoning techniques used with Large Language Models: - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: A prompting method where the LLM breaks down reasoning into intermediate steps - **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)**: An extension that explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree structure However, the research agents were unable to provide the specific information about: 1. How LLMs determine when to use CoT vs ToT 2. Common prompt formulas for these techniques This appears to be a limitation in the agent execution rather than the information being unavailable. A successful answer would require re-running the research with proper web search capabilities or access to technical documentation about these prompting techniques.\n\nAgent Outputs:\n\nAgent 0 (business-analyst):\nSummary: \nConfidence: 0.0\n\nAgent 1 (business-analyst):\nSummary: \nConfidence: 0.0\n\nAgent 2 (business-analyst):\nSummary: \nConfidence: 0.0\n\nAgent 3 (master):\nSummary: Could you clarify which specific techniques or domain you'd like me to compile formulas and best practices for? For example:\n\n- **Data Analysis**: Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, SUMIF, pivot tables), statistical methods\n- **Software Testing**: Test coverage formulas, quality metrics, testing strategies  \n- **Project Management**: Velocity calculations, burndown formulas, estimation techniques\n- **Financial Analysis**: NPV, IRR, ROI formulas, forecasting methods\n- **Algorithm Design**: Big O notation, complexity analysis, optimization techniques\n- **UX/Design**: Usability metrics, A/B testing formulas, conversion rate optimization\n\nPlease let me know which area(s) you're most interested in, and I'll compile comprehensive findings on the most commonly used formulas and best practices for those specific techniques.\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\n\nVerify this synthesis and provide quality assessment in JSON format.",
